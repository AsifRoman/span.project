As we planned our program of rally, cleanliness and tree plantation in the campus of Kamarhati Union Collegiate School.Due to some reasons, the Head Master of the School didn't give permission to students rally. So we have done our rest two plans i.e; cleanliness and tree plantation.</p>

	<p>Firstly, all big friends, youth and the students cleaned the ground and playground of the school.</p>

	<p>After that, we started tree plantation program and the first tree was planted by the Head Master of the School and the other assistant teachers also joined us.Then the students got excited and plant other trees. We made a group of two students who took responsibilities of taking care of that planted tree in school time like save from animals, watering and. We planted total 9 trees around ground, background and infront of the main gate of the school and gifted 2 other plants to the Head Master for planted in office.</p>
